  DEPRECATION: Legacy editable install of minference==0.1.6.0 from file:///scratch/gpfs/DANQIC/jz4391/MInference (setup.py develop) is deprecated. pip 25.1 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11457
